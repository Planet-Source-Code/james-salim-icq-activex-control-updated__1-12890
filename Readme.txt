MediEvilz(R) ICQ UDPv5 ActiveX Control
version 0.6.1

Thank you for downloading and trying out ICQ ActiveX Control.
Before you start using the control, you need to Copy the file
udpcore.dll to your System folder (C:\WIN\SYSTEM\ for win9x or
C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\ for win2000)

Whats New in version 0.6.0:
* The control does not uses Winsock control anymore, instead 
  it uses a library called AzuRe 1.0 which access winsock directly
  through its API
* It also does not use MS Timer control any more
* A few minor interface changes

Once again, I still have not made the ICQ client as of yet, or a
documentation to go with the control. You may however visit 
www.medievilz.com, just incase the release you downloaded is out-
dated.
